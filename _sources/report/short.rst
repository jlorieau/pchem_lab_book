Grading and Report
******************

Grading
=======

Experiments that require a report will be graded as follows:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - points
      - description
    * - 60
      - short lab report
    * - 20
      - answers to questions
    * - 20
      - achievements

Both the answers to questions and achievements are different for each
experiment.

Short Lab Report
================

The laboratory report will give the results of the experiment, show your
understanding of the relevant principles involved, demonstrate your ability to
analyze data, and perform error analysis, and briefly discuss your results
in a scientific manner. Reports must be typed using a word processor,
single-sided and double spaced, and submitted through Blackboard as a docx file.

The short lab report includes the following components:


#. Title Page

#. Abstract/Overview

#. Materials and Methods

#. Results

#. Answers to all Questions

#. Conclusions

#. References

#. Appendix which will include a copy of original data signed by the teaching
   assistant and printouts, spectra etc.

Title Page
----------

The title page contains the full title of the laboratory experiment, your name,
your lab partner’s name, your TA’s name, and the date.

Abstract/Overview
-----------------

**Length**: 1 paragraph, less than or equal to 5 sentences

An abstract is limited to at most one paragraph on one page. It is a brief
summary of the major purpose of the experiment, the method employed, the main
findings/observations, and the principal conclusion (your interpretation).
Quote actual values for one or two of the most important results. Abstracts
should be written in the past tense as they refer to work which has already
been done. The use of first person is strictly avoided.

.. admonition:: Example Overview
    :class: note

    The kinetics of peptide hydrolysis were monitored spectrophotometrically
    using o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and 2-mercaptoethanol. The second-order rate
    constant for the specific hydrolysis of ENP, a reference peptide, with
    trypsin was quantified by measuring the change in absorbance at 340nm and
    310K. A value of 0.82 ± 0.02 L mol\ :sup:`-1` s\ :sup:`-1` was obtained
    at 310 K. This experiment shows a convenient assay for measuring peptide
    hydrolysis and tracking the efficiency of proteases.

Materials and Methods
---------------------

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs

As the name implies, the materials and methods used in the experiments should
be reported in this section. The difficulty in writing this section is to
provide enough detail for the reader to understand the experiment without
overwhelming him or her. When procedures from a lab book or another report
are followed exactly, simply cite the work, noting that details can be found
in that particular source. However, it is still necessary to describe the
specific equipment used and the general theory of the experimental methods.
This can usually be done in a short paragraph.

Results
-------

The results section should summarize the data from the experiments without
discussing their implications. The data should be organized into tables,
figures, graphs, photographs, and so on. But data included in a table should
not be duplicated in a figure or graph.

All figures and tables should have descriptive titles and should include a
legend explaining any symbols, abbreviations, or special methods used. Figures
and tables should be numbered separately and should be referred to in the text
by number, for example:

    Figure 1 shows that the activity decreased after five minutes.
    The activity decreased after five minutes (fig. 1).

Figure captions and table titles should be self-explanatory; that is, the
reader should be able to understand them without referring to the text. All
columns and rows in tables and axes in figures should be labeled.

In this section of the report you should clearly present sample calculations
and justification of your results including an estimate of uncertainty. Be
sure that the results have the proper number of significant figures and the
appropriate units. Whenever possible, literature values should be given for
comparison. You should concentrate on general trends and differences and not
on trivial details. Many students organize and write the results section
before the rest of the report.

Answers to Questions
--------------------

Write the question number and answer the **4** assigned questions. Include
all derivations and write in descriptive paragraphs to receive all points.
**Do not copy the question in your report**.

Conclusions
-----------

**Length**: 1 paragraph

This is a short paragraph about purpose of experiment, results, errors,
problems, with an emphasis upon your interpretation of your results.

References
----------

This section lists all articles or books cited in your report. It is not the
same as a bibliography, which simply lists references regardless of whether
they were cited in the paper. The listing should be alphabetized by the last
names of the authors. Different journals require different formats for
citing literature. The format that includes the most information is given in
the following examples:

Papers
    Fox, J.W. 1988. Nest-building behavior of the catbird, Dumetella
    carolinensis. Journal of Ecology 47: 113-17.

Books
    Bird, W.Z. 1990. Ecological aspects of fox reproduction. Berlin: Guttenberg
    Press.
