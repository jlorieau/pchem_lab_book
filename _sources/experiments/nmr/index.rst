Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
**************************

Introduction
============

Spinning charges generate magnetic fields. Molecules comprise many sources
of magnetic fields: the movement of electrons in bonds, the spin of electrons
(up or down), the spin of nuclei, and others. The magnetic fields from electron
or nuclear spins can be represented by magnetic dipole moments--i.e. very
small north-south bar magnets. These magnetic dipoles align with or against
an applied, strong magnetic field, and we can use electromagnetic radiation,
like UV-Vis spectroscopy, to stimulate transitions and spin flips. We can
probe spin flips for electrons, with electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy,
or we can probe spin flips for nuclei, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy.

In chemistry, the most commonly probed spin types are spin-1/2 systems due to
their abundance and spectroscopic simplicity.
Electrons and nuclear isotopes such as :sup:`1`\ H, :sup:`13`\ C,
:sup:`15`\ N have an inherent spin-1/2. In a magnetic field, their
spin aligns with the magnetic field (m = 1/2) or against the magnetic field
(m = -1/2). All of these particles have the same amount of spin, but they
differ in their charge densities, which is quantified by a gyromagnetic ratio,
:math:`\gamma`. In a 14.1 Tesla magnetic field, transitions for electrons,
:sup:`1`\ H, :sup:`13`\ C and :sup:`15`\ N require electromagnetic
radiation with frequencies of 394-GHz, 600-MHz, 151-MHz and 60.8-MHz,
respectively. In this experiment, we will focus on nuclear spin
transitions for |1H|.

What makes NMR interesting from a chemist's perspective is that the local
magnetic fields around spins are very sensitive to the local environment and
contain rich information. A |1H| spin, for example, is bonded and
surrounded by eletrons which, when in a magnetic field, generate their own
local magnetic field that opposes the applied field. This field, known as
the chemical shift, depends on internal properties like electron density and
orientation, and at the simplest level, it's a direct measure of
electronegativity and bonding structure. Magnetic fields at each spin also
depend on other spins in the molecule, and additional peaks (splittings) are
manifested from spins that communicate through the bonding network (J-coupling)
or through space (dipole-dipole).

The hypersensitivity of nuclear spin field to local chemical environments isn't
he only advantage of NMR spectroscopy. Since we can produce non-equilibrium
spin states with relatively long lifetimes--100s of microseconds to seconds--we
can use time-dependent pulse experiments for spectroscopy. Practically speaking,
time-dependent Fourier-Transform NMR allows spectroscopists to measure and
correlate spectra in multiple dimensions.

NMR is not without drawbacks: it can require large amounts of sample
(milligrams), and it can be limited in the size and complexity of molecules
studied.

Chemical Shifts
---------------

Chemical shifts and J-couplings are not the strongest magnetic interactions,
but their impact remains detectable for molecules tumbling (rotating) in
solution isotropically--i.e. rotating in any direction.

In solution NMR, peaks change position (frequency) in a spectrum due to, at
least, chemical shifts. A peak can either be *downfield* (*deshielded*),
in which it has a higher frequency, or *upfield* (*shielded*), in which it has
a lower frequency. For historical reasons, the left-hand side of a 1D NMR
spectrum is downfield and *increases* in frequency whereas the right-hand side
of a 1D NMR spectrum is upfield and *decreases* in frequency.

The magnitude of the magnetic field generated by chemical
shifts increase in proportion to the strength of the applied magnetic field.
For example, the chemical shift magnetic fields in a 10 Tesla NMR are twice
as large as in a 5 Tesla NMR. Chemical shift magnetic fields are nevertheless
much smaller than the applied magnetic field--on the order of a million times
smaller. To be able to compare chemical shifts between NMR spectrometers with
different applied magnetic fields, NMR spectroscopists devised a new unit,
parts-per-million, taken by dividing the magnetic field strength of the
chemical shift by the applied field strength.

Chemical shifts can be used to identify the types of atoms in a molecule.
Consider the :sup:`1`\ H spins for hydrogens in a methyl group and an aldehyde.
The aldehyde has a much higher partial-positive charge on the hydrogen due to
the electron-withdrawing characteristic of the carbonyl. Consequently,
aldehyde protons are more downfield or deshielded than methyl protons.
Aldehyde :sup:`1`\ H spins appear at chemical shifts of 9-10ppm on the
left-hand side of the spectrum whereas methyl :sup:`1`\ H spins appear at
1-2ppm on the right-hand side of the spectrum. Atomic nuclei that are
surrounded by a larger amount of electron density are upfield (smaller ppm
value) to nuclei with less electron density (higher ppm value).

Since the position of peaks depends on electronegativity and other secondary
factors, the position of peaks in a spectrum can be used to identify different
functional groups or the number of spins within a molecule.

J-couplings
-----------

The magnetic fields generated by spins influence the local magnetic fields
of other spins. These are known as spin-spin couplings. This influence can be
directly through space or indirectly through the polarization of electrons in
the bonds between spins, like the chemical shift. The direct interaction of
spin magnetic fields--known as the dipole-dipole interaction
or dipolar interaction--is much stronger. For molecules that tumble
isotropically in solution, the dipolar interaction field averages to zero,
and it cannot be detected directly from the solution NMR spectrum. The spin-spin
coupling mediated through the electron cloud in bonds between spins is much
smaller, but it can be detected directly in the solution NMR spectrum. This
interaction is known as the J-coupling.

J-couplings produce splittings for magnetically non-equivalent spins. Splittings
are patterns in which a single peak--known as a singlet--can be divided into
groups of smaller peaks like a doublet (two peaks), triplet (three peaks),
quartet (four peaks) or more complicated pattern. The splitting pattern and
intensities of the peak splittings contain useful information on the types of
spins that are J-coupled. The intensities of the sub-peaks in a splitting group
follow the Boltzmann thermal distribution for each spin, and they are manifested
as a Pascal triangle.

Together with the chemical shift, J-couplings can be used to identify the
bonding network within a molecule and to identify the molecule itself.

.. admonition:: Example: Acetaldehyde J\ :sub:`HH`\ -couplings
    :class: note

    Acetaldehyde (:math:`\ce{CH3CHO}`) has 2 types of :sup:`1`\ H
    spins: a single aldehyde hydrogen and three methyl hydrogens. The J-coupling
    between these spins are separated by 3 bonds, and it is referred to as a
    :sup:`3`\ J-coupling. The methyl :sup:`1`\ H spins are split into a doublet:
    one peak comes from the aldehyde :sup:`1`\ H spins that point parallel to the
    applied magnetic field (spin up) and one peak comes from the aldehyde
    :sup:`1`\ H spins that point anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field
    (down down).

    The aldehyde :sup:`1`\ H spin is split into a quartet with a 1:3:3:1 intensity
    pattern. The outer peaks arise from methyl :sup:`1`\ H spins that have up-up-up
    or down-down-down spins. Multiple configurations generate the inner two
    peaks. The first inner peak is generated for methyl :sup:`1`\ H spins in the
    down-up-up, up-down-up or up-up-down configuration, and the second inner peak is
    generated for methyl :sup:`1`\ H spins in the down-down-up, down-up-down or
    up-down-down configuration. The intensities of the peaks follow the number of
    configurations that generate each peak: the outer peaks have a relative intensity
    of '1' because only 1 configuration can generate those peaks whereas each of
    the two inner peaks are generated by 3 configurations, and these have a relative
    intensity of '3'.

Acid-Base Titration
-------------------

Changes in the electron density around spins can produce large changes in
chemical shifts. One example of a large change in electron distribution
are the acid-base forms of a molecule. By titrating an ionizable group, the
chemical shifts of the spins around that ionizable group can change
significantly. These changes in chemical shift can be used to measure the
pKa of these ionizable groups.

.. admonition:: Example: Titration of phosphate
    :class: note

    :sup:`31`\ P is a naturally abundant spin-1/2 nucleus, and its
    chemical shift can be used to monitor the pKa and protonation states of
    phosphate [Biochem1981]_. As the pH of a solution with phosphate
    (:math:`\ce{PO4}`) is lowered, the phosphate oxygens are protonated and
    there is less electron density on the :sup:`31`\ P nucleus, producing a
    downfield (deshielded) change in chemical shift.

The simplest titratable system consists of an acid and a conjugate base (or a
base and a conjugate acid).

.. math::

    \ce{HA + H2O <=> H3O+ + A-}

To monitor this equilibrium using NMR, we need a peak in the NMR spectrum of
the acid (A). The acid may have many spins we could monitor--e.g. methyl,
methylene or methine :sup:`1`\ H spins--and the objective is to find a peak for
a functional group that is near the titratable group, and one with good signal
and in an non-congested region of the spectrum. For example, the methyl
:sup:`1`\ H spins spins in acetate could be used to titrate and measure the pKa
of the carboxylic group.

The peak we choose to monitor will have a chemical shift for the acid form
(:math:`\delta_{HA}`) and a chemical shift for the conjugate base form
(:math:`\delta_{A}`). The signal we measure is in fast exchange--i.e. the
kinetics of the above chemical reaction are much faster than the evolution of
the signal--and we measure an average chemical shift (:math:`\delta_{ave}`)
between the two forms.

.. math::

    \delta_{ave} = \chi_{HA} \delta_{HA} + (1 - \chi_{HA}) \delta_{A}

Here we have introduced :math:`\chi_{HA}`, the mole fraction of HA. When the
pH is much lower than the pKa of the reaction, nearly 100% of our acid is in
the :math:`\ce{HA}` form---i.e. :math:`\chi_{HA} = 1.0`. Conversely, when the
pH is much higher than the pKa of the reaction, nearly 100% of our acid is in
the conjugate base :math:`\ce{A-}` form---i.e. :math:`\chi_A = 1.0`---and nearly
0% is in the HA form---i.e. :math:`\chi_{HA} = 0.0`.

The pKa corresponds to the pH of the solution when the acid (HA) and conjugate
base (A) form have equal concentrations: :math:`\chi_{HA} = \chi_{A} = 0.5`.
This can be sean from the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation.

.. math::

    pH = pKa + \log\frac{[A]}{[HA]}

When [A] = [HA], then :math:`\log\frac{[A]}{[HA]} = \log 1.0 = 0.0`.

However, we'd like to be able to relate the pH from the Henderson–Hasselbalch
equation to the chemical shift of HA and A. First, we need to recognize that
the initial or total amount and concentration of 'A', :math:`[A]_{0}`, is
constant.

.. math::

    [A]_0 = [A] + [HA]

Regardless of the pH and the distribution of [A] and [HA], the original amount
we put in our sample, :math:`[A]_0`, does not change. Additionally, the
concentrations [A] and [HA] can be evaluated from the mole-fractions.

.. math::

    [HA] = \chi_{HA} [A]_0

.. math::

    [A] = \chi_{A} [A]_0 = (1 - \chi_{HA}) [A]_0

Combining the above equation with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation produces
a new equation with mole-fractions.

.. math::

    pH = pKa + \log\frac{1 - \chi_{HA}}{\chi_{HA}}

In a couple of steps, the equation can be rearranged as a function of
mole fraction.

.. math::

    10^{pH - pKa} = \frac{1 - \chi_{HA}}{\chi_{HA}} = \chi_{HA}^{-1} - 1

.. math::

    \chi_{HA} = \frac{1}{10^{pH - pKa} + 1}


And combined with the average chemical shift.

.. math::

    \delta_{ave} = \delta_{HA} \left( \frac{1}{10^{pH - pKa} + 1} \right) +
    \delta_{A} \left(1 - \frac{1}{10^{pH - pKa} + 1}\right)

    The following table shows example mole fractions and chemical shifts
    for 10.0 mM acetate in a solvent at different pHs. In this solvent,
    the acetate pKa is 4.60, the
    :math:`\delta_{HA}` chemical shift is 2.100 ppm, and the :math:`\delta_{A}`

NMR Experiments
---------------

NMR spectrometers are equipped with hundreds to thousands of 1-dimensional or
multi-dimensional experiments. These experiments are known as pulse sequences.
Pulse sequences comprise sequences of timed radio-frequency (RF) pulses to
manipulate the NMR signal (coherences) in one or more dimensions. We will be
using a few different pulse sequences on our samples.

|1H| 1-dimensional spectrum with |H2O| suppression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the simplest NMR experiment, the spins are stimulated by RF
radiation--known as a pulse. Water suppression involves the spectroscopic
filtering to suppress the signal of |1H2O|. In a typical NMR sample, the analyte
has a concentration in the uM to mM range. When disolved in water as a solvent,
the signal of |1H2O| has a concentration up to 110M--typically 100,000
times greater than our analyte. Since the |1H2O| signal arises as a single peak,
we can implement pulses to either avoid exciting |1H2O| or to suppress its
signal. The suppression is rarely perfect, and small distortions may arise
in the final spectrum around the water peak at 4.7 ppm.

|1H|-|1H| 2-dimensional COrrelation SpectroscopY (COSY)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A 2-dimensional NMR experiment correlates the peaks and chemical shifts of
spins with other, related spins. In the |1H|-|1H| COSY, the signal
(coherence) of one |1H| spin is transferred to and measured on another
spin through the |1H|-|1H| J-coupling [COSY1976]_. When two sets of
|1H| spins have a sufficiently large J\ :sub:`HH`\ -coupling---typically
on the order of a few Hz to 10s of Hz for |1H|-|1H| J-couplings--
they produce a *crosspeak*. In contrast to *diagonal peaks*, which show up on
the 1:1 line on the 2-dimensional spectrum, *crosspeaks* appear elsewhere in
the spectrum. Their location gives the chemical shifts of the two set of
correlated |1H| spins and their integral contains information on the
magnitude of the J-coupling.

A 2-dimensional (or higher dimensional) experiment has many advantages. The
first advantage is that many peaks overlapping in a 1-dimensional spectrum
---known as congestion--are spread out and can be more easily isolated and
identified in a higher dimensional spectrum. Another important advantage is that
different measurements or values can be encoded in the spectrum. For example,
the intensity of peaks in a :sup:`1`\ H-:sup:`1`\ H NOESY 2D contains information
on the distance between hydrogen atoms whereas the intensity of peaks in a
|1H|-|1H| COSY 2D contains information on the connectivity of
|1H| spins in the bonding topology of a molecule.

We will use a |1H|-|1H| COSY 2D spectrum to identify the
hydrogens that are within 2-3 bonds of other hydrogens. We can then use
a "peak walking" procedure to follow the hydrogens down a sequence of heavy
atoms (C, N or O) with hydrogens within a molecule.

.. admonition:: Example: Ethanol |1H|-|1H| COSY 2D
    :class: note

    The following shows the contour plot of a simulated 2-dimensional COSY
    spectrum for ethanol. Ethanol's |1H| spectrum has a methylene peak
    (:math:`\delta_H` = 3.69 ppm) and methyl peak (:math:`\delta_H` = 1.22 ppm).
    The |1H|-|1H| COSY 2D spectrum includes two diagonal
    peaks and two crosspeaks. The crosspeaks between the methyl (CH3) and
    methylene (CH2) groups arise because the :sup:`3`\ J\ :sub:`HH`\ -coupling
    is about 5 Hz.

    The hydroxyl hydrogen is not shown and it is often not visible in aqueous
    solvent due to hydrogen exchange---i.e. rapid exchange with the hydrogens
    of the solvent. The splittings from homonuclear J-coupling were suppressed
    in the simulated spectrum.

    .. plot:: experiments/nmr/plots/cosy2d_ethanol.py

|1H|-X 1-dimensional DEPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Distortionless Enhancement Polarization Transfer (DEPT) pulse sequence
transfers signal (coherences) from |1H| to a magnetically-active heavy atom
like |13C| or |15N| [DEPT1982]_. The transfer is possible when there is an appreciable
J-coupling between the |1H| spin and the |13C| or |15N| spin, which occurs
when the two are directly bonded. For example, the
:sup:`1`\ J\ :sub:`HC`\ -coupling for a |1H|-|13C| bond is about 140 Hz,
while the :sup:`1`\ J\ :sub:`HN`\ -coupling for a |1H|-|15N| bond is about
-93 Hz.

The DEPT sequence, and the related INEPT sequence [INEPT1979]_, can enhance
the signal intensity of low-gamma nuclei---that is, nuclei with gyromagnetic
ratios much smaller than |1H|. Additionally, the pulse sequence can be run
with different pulses to encode multiplicity information in the
intensities of peaks:

#.  The |13C| DEPT-45 experiment shows |13C| peaks with positive intensity
    for methine (:math:`\ce{CH}`), methylene (:math:`\ce{CH2}`) and methyl
    groups (:math:`\ce{CH3}`) groups.

#.  The |13C| DEPT-90 experiment shows |13C| peaks with positive intensity
    for methine (:math:`\ce{CH}`) groups.

#.  The |13C| DEPT-135 experiment shows |13C| peaks with positive intensity for
    methine (:math:`\ce{CH}`) and methyl (:math:`\ce{CH3}`) groups and peaks
    with negative intensity for methylene (:math:`\ce{CH2}`) groups.

|1H|-X 2-dimensional HETCOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HETeronuclear CORrelation (HETCOR) 2-dimensional experiment correlates
the chemical shift of |1H| spins with the chemical shift of the bonded |13C|, |15N|
(or other low-gamma 'X') spin. As with other multidimensional NMR experiments,
HETCOR decreases congestion of peaks from a 1-dimensional spectrum. It
additionally can be used to correlate the peaks from a |1H| 1-dimensional
spectrum to the peaks of a X-spin 1-dimensional spectrum.

There are a variety of 2-dimensional heteronuclear experiments, including the
HSQC and HMQC. HETCOR is different from these as the final signal is measured
from the low-gamma spin instead of the |1H| spin, thereby significantly reducing
the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum. HETCOR nevertheless offers some
advantages that could be useful:

#.  Molecules without the X-spin, whether it be |13C|, |15N| or another spin,
    are not visible in the final spectrum. For samples in |1H2O|, this
    effectively suppresses the strong signal from the solvent.

#.  Some molecules, like Intrinsically Disorder Proteins (IDP), have very narrow
    |13C| or |15N| peaks spread over a large frequency range. Collecting the
    full resolution spectra of these samples can take a long time, and a HETCOR
    can be more time efficient if there is sufficient sample to produce a
    good signal.

#.  Peaks for |1H| spins that hydrogen exchange may more appear more easily in a
    HETCOR

Procedures
==========

Materials
---------

- Two glass pipets, each with a bulb
- 10-mL centrifuge/Falcon tube
- 25-mL Erlenmeyer flask
- 7-10 clean NMR tubes with caps
- Small magnetic stirbar (0.5-1.0 cm)
- Magnetic stir plate
- pH meter
- |2H2O| (|D2O|)
- Unknown sample

A. pH meter calibration
-----------------------

#.  Thoroughly rinse the pH meter probe with |ddH2O|.

#.  Place the probe in a calibration solution (pH 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0).

#.  If the pH meter read-out is different from the calibration solution's
    indicated pH by more than 0.03 units, recalibrate the pH meter with the TA.

.. admonition:: Store the probe in a saturated KCl solution when not in use
    :class: warning

    Do not leave the probe outside of a solution for longer than a
    minute. The KCl solution must be rinsed from the tip before inserting the
    probe in your solution to avoid contaminating your solution with KCl.

.. admonition:: The pH probe is fragile
    :class: warning

    The pH probe glass surface is fragile and prone to scratching and damage.
    Carefully wipe the pH probe tip with lintless and staticless wipes (e.g.
    Kimwipes)

B. 1.0M HCl solution, 10-mL
---------------------------

.. admonition:: Work in a fumehood and use lab goggles and gloves!
    :class: danger

    HCl is a concentrated acid, and it can cause serious tissue damage to
    skin and to your eyes

#.  Add 5.0 mL |ddH2O| to a 10-mL centrifuge (Falcon) tube. The exact
    concentration of this solution does not need to be known, and the
    volumetric gradations on the tube can be used to estimate this volume.

#.  Add about 0.5 mL of concentrated HCl (37%, ~10M) to the 10-mL centrifuge
    tube. Do not use a micropipet because the HCl vapor may damage the pipet
    internals. Instead add about 1/2 the volume of a glass pipet, which is
    labeled the "titration" pipet.

#.  Mix the solution in the 10-mL centrifuge tube with the titration glass
    pipet by sucking the solution in-and-out of the pipet. At this stage,
    do not screw the cap on the centrifuge tube and invert the solution--this
    would create a closed system, and the heat released from mixing the HCl
    and |H2O| could vaporize the solution and cause a small explosion.

C. Unknown in 100mM phopshate buffer, 10% |D2O|, 10.0-mL
--------------------------------------------------------

#.  | Add 141 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate (:math:`\ce{Na2HPO4}`)
      to a 25-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
    | FW: 141.96

#.  Add 8.5 mL of |H2O| and 1.0 mL |2H2O| (|D2O|)

#.  Mix 500 uL of the unknown to reach a final volume of 10.0 mL.

#.  Rinse a small magnetic stirbar with |ddH2O| and add to the solution

#.  Place the Erlenmeyer with the solution on a magnetic stirplate that is
    switched off, and slowly increase the rotation rate of the magnetic stirrer.

#.  Measure and note the initial pH. Be careful that the pH probe does not
    make contact with the magnetic stirrer or the walls of the Erlenmeyer flask.

#.  Label the a new glass pipet with "sampling" and remove an aliquot of about
    500 ul in a NMR tube and label the tube with the description
    of the sample, including the current pH.

.. admonition:: Label your samples
    :class: warning

    Label your samples, and make sure the labels are readable and have complete
    information. Losing track of your samples is the easiest and most avoidable
    way to invalidate an experiment, and it could pose a safety or environmental
    issue when the sample needs to be disposed.


D. Titration of the solution with the unknown
---------------------------------------------

At this stage, you should have the pH meter probe in your unknown solution,
which is mixing continuously with a magnetic stirrer.

#.  Using the "titration" glass pipet, add one or more drops of the 1.0 M HCl
    solution. The drops should fall directly into the solution, and they should
    not make contact with the pH meter probe or the Erlenmeyer flask walls.

#.  Continue to add drops of 1.0M HCl until the pH has decreased by about 0.5
    units.

#.  Collect a 500 ul aliquot in an NMR tube and label the tube

#.  Continue to slowly acidify the solution and remove a 500 ul aliquot for
    every ~0.5 pH unit drop. Continue this process until the final aliquot at
    pH 3.5 has been collected.

E. Collection of NMR spectra
----------------------------

Collect the following spectra with the help of the NMR TA:

#. For **all** of your pH samples, collect a |1H| 1D experiment

#. For **one** of your pH samples, collect a |1H|-|1H| 2D COSY, |13C| DEPT-45,
   DEPT-90, DEPT-135 and a |13C|-HETCOR


Results and Discussion
======================

Error Analysis
--------------

The error in the pH measurement can be estimated from the pH meter reading of
the standard solutions.

The error in the chemical shift can be estimated using a peak or a group of
peaks full-width at half-height (FWHH) and the peak's signal-to-noise ration
(SNR):

.. math::

    \sigma_\delta = \frac{FWHH}{2 \cdot SNR}

The peak integral's error can be estimated by integrating over a similar range
in the noise region of the spectrum.

Calculations
------------

pKa Non-Linear Regression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The chemical shift pH titration equation is the following:

.. math::

    \delta_{ave} = \delta_{HA} \left( \frac{1}{10^{pH - pKa} + 1} \right) +
    \delta_{A} \left(1 - \frac{1}{10^{pH - pKa} + 1}\right)

Alternatively, the function can be re-arranged for the non-linear regression

.. math::

    \delta_{ave} = \delta_{A} + \frac{\delta_{HA} - \delta_{A}}{10^{pH - pKa} + 1}

Save the pH values (x-values), the chemical shifts (y-values) and the
corresponding chemical shift errors (y errors) as a csv file. Load the csv
file in your plotting program and conduct a non-linear regression with 3
parameters: :math:`\delta_A`, :math:`\delta_{HA}` and pKa. Different variable
names (x, y) and parameter names (a, b, c) may need to be used in the input
for the non-linear regression.

.. math::

    y = a + \frac{b - a}{10^{x - c} + 1}

Include the final plot, the fit parameters and their uncertainties as well as
the :math:`\chi^2` and :math:`\chi^2_{reduced}` of the fits.
