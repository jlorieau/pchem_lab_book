Safety Rules
************

Department of Chemistry—The University of Illinois Chicago

The following is a list of basic safety rules for the laboratory. Please sign
the statement at the end of this list to indicate you have read and understood
the rules.

Eye protection worn at all times
    Eye protection must be worn in the laboratory **at all times when
    experimentation is ongoing**. Proper eye protection consists of wearing
    splash-proof chemical safety goggles. Safety glasses are not acceptable.
    Students may purchase approved safety goggles from the stockroom or UIC
    bookstore. Students who wear prescription glasses need to wear goggles
    over their glasses. Unprotected contact lenses are particularly dangerous
    in the case of a chemical splash or vapor exposure, and their use is
    prohibited. If a chemical splashes into your eyes, rinse it out immediately
    and thoroughly using the eyewash fountain for at least 15 minutes.

Wear gloves in the lab--not out of the lab
    Gloves must be worn by everyone working in the lab space when
    experimentation is ongoing. If you need to leave the lab for any reason,
    properly remove and dispose of your gloves. Do not touch your face,
    clothes, or any item that will leave the lab with a gloved hand. To avoid
    contaminating common surfaces with chemicals, **wearing gloves in the
    hallway is prohibited**. Always, even after wearing gloves, wash your
    hands with soap and water before leaving the lab!

Wear full clothing
    Students must wear fitted clothing covering arms, torso, legs, and feet
    while working in the laboratory. Wear clothing you can remove easily in
    case of an accident. Clothing should protect you from accidental spills
    and splashes and should not be cumbersome or present a safety hazard.
    **Clothes should cover the body from the shoulders to the toes**. Tank tops,
    sleeveless shirts, shorts, or leggings that cover to the shin will not
    protect you from laboratory hazards and are prohibited. Wear practical,
    close-toed shoes whenever you are in the lab. Shoes with high heels, open
    toes, or made of woven materials are not permitted in the laboratory.
    Sandals and flip-flops are not appropriate! It is the student’s
    responsibility to wear appropriate clothing to the lab.

Tie long hair and remove jewelry
    Long hair needs to be tied back. You must remove any jewelry that may come
    into contact with chemicals, such as rings, before working in the lab.

Read Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
    You must understand the hazards associated with the chemicals involved
    before you start the experiment. If you are unsure about the hazards and
    protection you need, Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which provide detailed
    information, are available from your instructor. Always pay attention
    to safety briefings and instructions given by your instructor.

Do NOT work alone
    **It is prohibited to work in the laboratory alone!**
    Experiments must never be left unattended. Do not perform unauthorized
    experiments. **Do not enter a lab space without your instructor’s
    permission.**

Use appropriate protection
    Increase the degree of protection (use safety face shields, fume hoods,
    etc.) when the hazards increase. When using a fume hood, set the equipment
    and chemicals back at least 15 centimeters from the hood sash. Be certain
    that the hood is operating properly prior to the execution of your work!
    Never open a fume hood sash more than what is necessary for safe work,
    and never walk away from an open fume hood. Never evaporate flammable
    solvents on a hot plate in an open system. An efficient condenser system
    must be used.

Know the equipment before using the equipment
    Be certain that you understand the proper use and operation of all
    laboratory equipment. If in doubt, ask your instructor.

No food
    Never consume any food, gum, beverages, or medication in the lab. The
    application of cosmetics or the use of tobacco products is prohibited
    in the laboratory.

Don't consume chemicals
    Pipetting by mouth is prohibited! Never inhale or taste chemicals!

Use intact glassware
    Always check your glassware and discard any with chips, breaks, or obvious
    flaws. Broken glassware must be disposed of in glass waste and not allowed
    to accumulate on the benchtop. Used Pasteur pipettes are to be disposed of
    into glass waste. Never throw away broken glass into a regular garbage or
    recycling container.

Lubricate fittings
    Never force glass tubing into rubber stoppers. Use proper lubricant and
    safety technique when inserting anything through corks or rubber stoppers.

Limit and do not contaminate your electronics
    Using personal electronic devices while in the laboratory is restricted
    to activities as determined by your instructor (i.e., taking pictures for
    a lab procedure). The recreational use of cell phones, iPods, iPads,
    portable music players, computers, smartwatches, etc. is prohibited in
    all lab spaces.

Flames and flammables don't mix
    Flames are never allowed when flammable gases or liquids are in use.
    Always alert others before lighting a flame. Keep paper and other
    flammable material away from open flames.

Report accidents and injuries
    In case of an injury, such as a cut or a burn, notify your instructor
    immediately. An incident report must be filed with the stockroom. In case
    of a fire or an imminently dangerous situation, notify everyone who may
    be affected immediately. Be prepared and alert to what is going on around
    you. If you feel unwell, notify your instructor immediately. The most
    crucial action is to inform your instructor so that they can arrange
    transport to the appropriate medical facility.

Identify safety equipment BEFORE experiments
    Know the location and operation of fire extinguishers, exit doors, spill
    kit, first aid kit, eyewash stations, safety showers, and fire alarm pull
    stations.

Clean spills (solid, liquids)
    Clean up spills immediately as directed by your instructor! Never place
    materials on the floor! Glassware and other equipment must be cleaned at
    the end of the experiment.

Dispose waste in the right place
    Follow your instructor’s directions for the disposal of chemicals. Never
    pour anything down a sink drain without the explicit permission of your
    instructor. The improper disposal of chemicals is illegal and can result
    in a possible personal hazard or environmental contamination!

**Working in the laboratory presents some possible dangers and requires a
serious attitude, coordination with others, and adherence to specific rules.
Inattention, lack of common sense, and game-playing are factors that can make
the laboratory an unsafe place. It is essential to consult with your instructor
if you are uncertain about a procedure or safety protocol.**

**All safety rules are strictly enforced by the instructors, the Chemical
Safety Officer, and Mr. Tom Rickhoff, Director of Undergraduate Laboratories.
Failure to obey any safety protocols or procedures will result in your
dismissal from the lab.**
